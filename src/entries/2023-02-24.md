The new data fetch is much easier and more good visually.

```tsx title="posts/page.tsx" {2-3, 7}
async function getPosts() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  return posts;
}

async function Page() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
...
}
```

\_documents.tsx and \_app.tsx a now layout.tsx.
Inherited from app, you can still write common processing on all pages.

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"  showLineNumbers {7}
import AppProvider from 'components/AppProvider';

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <AppProvider>{children}</AppProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Components prefixed with 'client' can be included in dynamically async components. This means that even with async `(server) components`, you are free to include `'use client'` components.

In the this example, the AppProvider component is a 'use client' component.

In my feeling, I don't feel constrained by React Server Components.
